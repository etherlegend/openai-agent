# OpenAI Agent Framework ü§ñ

Connect NodeJS/Typescript Functions With OpenAI Function Call APIs!!

Easily integrate NodeJs/Typescript functions with OpenAI GPT Function Call APIs to build super awesome agents! This package makes it easy for you to integrate OpenAI's GPT Functions into your applications by providing a structured framework for creating Agents and their related tools and functions.

[Read about Function APIs here if you are not aware about it](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates?ref=upstract.com) - how ever, specific knowledge of OpenAI API/structure is not required to use this package.



## Getting Started üöÄ

First, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. This package is built using TypeScript, so you might also want to have the TypeScript compiler installed globally. You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

To install the OpenAI Agent package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install openai-agent
```


## Setup üõ†Ô∏è

To interact with OpenAI's GPT Functions and creating agents, you'll need an OpenAI API key and the model ID you want to use. To provide these details, create a `.env` file in the root of your project:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo-0613
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serp_key 
```

SERPAPI_API_KEY is optional and required only if you use the InternetTools

You'll need to replace `your_openai_api_key` and `your_serp_key` with your actual OpenAI API key and the SERP key



## Building an Agent ü§ñ

Creating an agent is as simple as instantiating the `OpenAIAgent` class. Here's a basic example:

```ts
import { OpenAIAgent } from 'openai-agent';

const myAgent = new OpenAIAgent(myApiKey, myModel);
```

Now your agent is ready to go!



## Creating Custom Functions üîß

The real power of OpenAIAgent Framework comes from its ability to call predefined functions using `OpenAIFunction` decorator. This lets you create highly interactive and versatile agents.

Here's an example of a function that searches the Internet:

```ts
import { OpenAIFunction } from 'openai-agent';

class MyFunctions {
  @OpenAIFunction(
    "Searches the internet using SerpApi to get search results",
    {
      query: {
        type: "string",
        description: "The search query",
        required: true,
      },
    }
  )
  async searchInternet(query: string): Promise<string> {
    // Your search implementation here...
  }
}
```



## Example Usage üìù

Once you've set up your agent and functions, you can put them together like this:

```ts
import { OpenAIAgent } from 'openai-agent';

// Initialize your OpenAI Agent
const myAgent = new OpenAIAgent(myApiKey, myModel);


// Provide your functions to the agent
const result = await myAgent.runAgent(
  "search the internet for 'best AI tools'",
  [new MyFunctions()]
);

console.log(result.content);
```


## Crazier Example Usages üë©‚Äçüíª

Here are some more examples of how you can use this to create agents with few example function packages:

### Agent that can use your Terminal üíª

```typescript
const agent1 = new OpenAIAgent(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, process.env.OPENAI_MODEL);
const osInfoResponse = await agent1.runAgent(
    [{ role: "user", content: "get my os info and write a poem about it" }],  
    [new TerminalFunctions()],5
);
console.log(osInfoResponse?.content);
```

### Agent that can Search the Web üåê

```typescript
const agent2= new OpenAIAgent(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, process.env.OPENAI_MODEL);
const internetSearchResponse = await agent2.runAgent(
    [{ role: "user", content: 'search internet for latest news on OpenAI functions and get me the titles & links to top 5 articles' }],  
    [new InternetFunctions()], 10
);
console.log(internetSearchResponse?.content);
```

### Agent that can use your Terminal to do what you ask üõ†

```typescript
const agent3= new OpenAIAgent(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, process.env.OPENAI_MODEL);
const taskResponse = await agent3.runAgent(
    [{ role: "user", content: 'you are an expert ai assistant. Ask the user to give you inputs and do what she/he asks for, and do this in a loop, till he types exit' }],  
    [new TerminalFunctions()], 10
);
console.log(taskResponse?.content);
```

These are just a few examples of what you can do with the OpenAI Agent package! Dive in and explore, and let the AI revolution begin.
